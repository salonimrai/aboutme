	  <h1>Introduction</h1>
	  <p>I'm an engineer who has forgotten how to code! I worked on the IE8 team (CSS platform) and - for shame - I don't remember the various options for float. My objective is to re-learn, learn more and eventually be able to build my own website. I currently work in Business Operations at Lending Club.</p>
